The ceremonies start with the Ganesh pooja, Usually, a private ceremony that takes place with the couple and their close families to honour good fortune, followed by the mendhi ceremony the next day where henna patterns are painted on the bride and her female friends and family. That evening, there's often the sangeet- a musical night to welcome all the wedding guests, with the main ceremony and reception happening on the third day.
